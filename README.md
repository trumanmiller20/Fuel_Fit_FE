### **_Motivation_**

This project represents an accumulation of knowledge built over 12 weeks and 420 hours of study in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. I have a passion for fitness and nutrition and wanted to communicate that through this PERN stack application.

### **_Description:_**

This PERN stack application provides users with an intuitive platform from which they can calculate their personalized macronutrient needs based on their TDEE and plan their grocery shopping around those needs, promoting positive personal change and confidence.
